    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        Indulge in the exquisite layers of Tiramisu, a beloved Italian dessert that 
        literally translates to "pick me up" or "cheer me up." This elegant treat 
        features delicate ladyfingers dipped in rich coffee, nestled between luscious 
        layers of creamy mascarpone cheese, and dusted with a generous blanket of cocoa 
        powder. The interplay of bitter coffee, sweet and velvety cream, and the subtle 
        hint of cocoa creates a harmonious and utterly satisfying dessert that's perfect 
        for any occasion here in Lansdale, from a cozy evening in to a celebratory gathering. 
        Prepare to be enchanted by its simple yet sophisticated flavors and its wonderfully 
        light and airy texture.

    <h5>Yields: 8 servings</h5>
    <h5>Prep time: Approximately 30 minutes (plus at least 4 hours of chilling time)</h5>

    <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups freshly brewed strong coffee, cooled to room temperature</li>
            <li>¼ cup coffee liqueur (such as Kahlúa) or dark rum (optional)</li>
            <li>24-30 ladyfingers (savoiardi biscuits)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 pound (16 ounces) cold mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
        </ul>
    

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <h4>Preparing the Coffee Mixture</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>In a shallow dish, combine the cooled coffee and the coffee liquer or rum (if using). Set aside.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Making the Zabaflione (<em>Egg Yolk Cream Base</em>)</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water), whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until the mixture becomes pale yellow and thickened, about 5-7 minutes. The mixture should be warm to the touch.</li>
        <li>Remove the bowl from the heat and continue whisking for another 5 minutes until the mixture has cooled down and thickened further. This step is important to prevent the eggs from cooking and to create a light and airy base.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Incorporating the Mascarpone</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, whicsk the cold mascarpone cheese until it's smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Gradually fold the cooled egg yolk mixture into the mascarpone cheese until well combined and the mixture is smooth.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Whipping the Cream</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In another clean bowl, using an electric mixer (handheld or stand mixer), whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to over-whip.</li>
        <li>Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture in two additions, being careful not to deflate the cream. This will create a light and airy texture for your tiramisu.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Assembling the Tiramisu</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dip each ladyfinger briefly into the coffee mixture, just for a few seconds on each side. You want them to be soaked but not soggy.</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of an 9x13 inch baking dish or a similar-sized serving dish. You may need to break some ladyfingers to fit.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture evenly over the layer of ladyfingers.</li>
        <li>Dust the cream layer generously with sifted cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>Arrange another layer of coffee-soaked ladyfingers over the cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>Spread the remaining mascarpone cream mixture evenly over the second layer of ladyfingers.</li>
        <li>Dust the top layer generously with sifted cocoa powder.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Chilling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. This chilling time allows the flavors to meld together and the tiramisu to set properly. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Serving</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Before serving, you can dust with a little more cocoa powder if desired.</li>
        <li>To serve, cut into squares or use a spoon to scoop out portions. Enjoy this classic Italian treat!</li>
    </ol>
