            <li>2 heads romaine lettuce</li>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <h4>Preparing the Caesar Dressing</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mash the minced garlic and anchovy fillets (if using) together into a paste using the back of a spoon or a mortar and pestle. This helps to release their flavor.</li>
        <li>Add the egg yolk and Dijon mustard to the bowl and whisk until well combined and slightly pale.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
        <li>Very slowly drizzle in the extra virgin olive oil while continuously whisking. Whisking slowly and constantly helps to emulsify the dressing, creating a creamy texture.</li>
        <li>Stir in the 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Season the dressing generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Be mindful of the saltiness of the Parmesan cheese and anchovies (if used). Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Preparing the Salad</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large salad bowl, place the chopped or torn romaine lettuce.</li>
        <li>Pour about two-thirds of the Caesar dressing over the lettuce.</li>
        <li>Gently toss the lettuce with the dressing until all the leaves are evenly coated. Add more dressing if needed, depending on your preference.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Assembling and Serving</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the croutons to the salad bowl and toss lightly.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dressed salad to individual plates or a serving platter.</li>
        <li>Garnish generously with shaved Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy the classic flavors of your homemade Caesar Salad!</li>
