    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    

    <h4>Preparing the Chicken</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place each chicken breast between two pieces of 
            plastic wrap or in a resealable plastic bag. 
            Using a meat mallet or the flat side of a heavy skillet,
            pound the chicken to an even thickness of about ½ inch. 
            This helps them cook evenly and quickly.</li>
        <li>In a shallow dish, combine the flour, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>In another shallow dish, whisk the eggs.</li>
        <li>In a third shallow dish, mix together the Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and the 1/2 cup
            of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Dredge each chicken cutlet in the flour mixture, making sure to coat both sides. 
            Shake off any excess flour.</li>
        <li>Dip the floured chicken into the whisked eggs, again coating both sides. Allow 
            any excess egg to drip off.</li>
        <li>Finally, press each egg-coated chicken cutlet firmly into the breadcrumb mixture, 
            ensuring both sides are evenly coated.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Making the Marinara Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.</li>
        <li>Pour in the can of crushed tomatoes. Add the dried oregano, dried basil, and red pepper flakes (if using).</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it cook gently for at least 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Cooking the Chicken</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat ¼ cup of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. The oil should shimmer but not smoke.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the breaded chicken cutlets in the hot skillet, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. You may need to cook them in batches.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165°F (74°C).</li>
        <li>Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Assembling and Baking the Chicken Parmesean</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees farrenheidt (190 degrees celsius)</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of the marinara sauce in the bottom of a baking dish (large enough to hold all the chicken).</li>
            <li>Place the cooked chicken cutlets in a single layer over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spoon a generous amount of the remaining marinara sauce over each chicken cutlet.</li>
            <li>Top each cutlet with shredded or sliced mozzarella cheese and sprinkle with the remaining ¼ cup of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and lightly golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Serve</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Garnish the Chicken Parmesan with fresh chopped basil leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve hot over your favorite cooked pasta, or alongside a fresh salad or crusty bread.</li>
    </ol>
