Intro: This project is going to be a website with multiple recipes attached.

The home page has a title, "Ben's Recipes" with 3 links to italian cuisine recipes: chicken parm, caesar salad, and tiramisu.

On each recipe page, there is an image of the final product followed by a description, ingredients, and instructions on how to make the recipe. 

This site is easily navigatable with links taking you to each page from the home page and bac again.
